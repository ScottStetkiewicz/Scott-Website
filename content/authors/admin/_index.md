Starting out as an archaeometallurgist, I became deeply involved in statistics, data science and visualization technologies over the course of my PhD. For the past five years my career has focused on using open source programming for analysis and visualization of a wide array of data types. I'm particularly interested in combining quantitative methods and modeling with social science research questions.
