This is a portfolio of personal coding projects I have produced over the past several years. Some of these posts have served as the basis for projects I have been contracted for, while others were done simply to learn more about various data science topics. Much of this code is in `r`, but I have also uploaded `python` - based Jupyter notebooks.
