My interest in teaching and commitment to advancing my own pedagogical skills led me to pursue accreditation (as an Associate Fellow) with the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk); an independent, non-profit organization that delivers innovative training to University educators and promotes excellence in teaching. Drawing on this background, my educational practice focuses on continuous feedback integration into course structure, non-traditional assessment schemes, and fostering interactive classroom environments. Formal peer evaluations by colleagues particularly note my strengths in developing rapport/encouraging discussions and promoting the expression of diverse viewpoints in my classes.  

I have taught on the following courses, covering a diverse array of archaeological methods, theory and specializations:

- ARCA08004: [Archaeology 1A](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/11-12/dpt/cxarca08004.htm)
- ARCA08005: [Archaeology 1B](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/11-12/dpt/cxarca08005.htm)
- ARCA1002: [Gallia from the 3rd Century BC to Augustus](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/11-12/dpt/cxarca10027.htm)

Moreover, I have provided in-depth ArcGIS and ArcGIS Online training sessions for faculty, students and support staff at Edinburgh (2018) and Wellesley College (2019), catering to a wide range of technological backgrounds/capabilities.

Outside of the classroom, I was an invited speaker by the SRUC (Scotland's Rural College) to present at their _Skills Transfer Workshop for Early Career Researchers_, providing training to graduate students and staff on the use of `R`, `shiny` and other visualization technologies in scientific research.
